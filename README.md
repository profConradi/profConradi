# 👋 Hi, I'm Simone Conradi!

## 🎓 Academic Background
- **2004:** Graduated with honors in Theoretical Physics, focusing on non-commutative field theories.
- **2008:** Earned a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Genoa, concentrating on the innovative study of the properties of high-temperature quark and gluon plasma through lattice numerical simulations.

## 🚄 Professional Experience
- **Ansaldo STS / Hitachi Rail:** Over 10 years of experience in the railway automation sector, taking on roles from Developer and System Administrator to Work Package Leader.
- **Consulting:** Specialist in applying mathematical models and machine learning algorithms to finance.

## 👨‍🏫 Currently
- Teaching computer science at ITIS Delpozzo in Cuneo, also qualified to teach mathematics and physics. Specializing in the "Computer Science - Smart Robot" track.
- Engaged in didactic methodologies for coding and the use of new technologies in teaching computer science.
- I teach ChatGPT prompt engineering courses for teachers, [like this one in italian](https://github.com/profConradi/conferences-lectures/blob/1cd0a1ae8ed50e1de5ec46bf34be86ccf8b0da92/Slide_lab_Conradi.pdf).

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- STEM education: I am dedicated to the field of STEM, with a particular focus on introducing the use of Python to solve mathematics and physics problems in high school. My goal is to empower students by providing them with the tools and knowledge to apply computational methods to traditional scientific disciplines, fostering a deeper understanding and innovation in these areas.
- Use of Large Language Models in education.
- Math visualizations like this [one](https://mathematical-oncology.org/art/276/). Please see my [X (Tweeter) profile](https://twitter.com/S_Conradi).
- Agent Based Models.
- Fractals.
  
## 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn:
- Something about Computational Social Science.
- Physics of Complex Systems.
- New Python framework such [Apple mlX](https://github.com/ml-explore).
- Various mathematical topics.

## 📚 Publications
- **Artificial Intelligence**, published by Zanichelli, a guide for those approaching the AI world with curiosity and a desire to learn.
